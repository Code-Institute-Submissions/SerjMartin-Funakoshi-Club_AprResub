            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Gichin Funakoshi (船越 義珍, Funakoshi Gichin, November 10, 1868 – April 26, 1957)
                was the founder of Shotokan karate-do, perhaps the most widely known style of karate,
                and is known as a "father of modern karate". Following the teachings of Anko Itosu and
                Anko Asato, he was one of the Okinawan karate masters who introduced karate, but after
                Ankō Itosu sensei, Funakoshi sensei's teacher, had introduced the art pre-1922, to the
                Japanese mainland in 1922. He taught karate at various Japanese universities and became
                honorary head of the Japan Karate Association upon its establishment in 1949.
