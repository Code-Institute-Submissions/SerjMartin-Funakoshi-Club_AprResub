                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Gichin Funakoshi (船越 義珍, Funakoshi Gichin, November 10, 1868 – April 26, 1957)
                    was the founder of Shotokan karate-do, perhaps the most widely known style of karate,
                    and is known as a "father of modern karate". Following the teachings of Anko Itosu and
                    Anko Asato, he was one of the Okinawan karate masters who introduced karate, but after
                    Ankō Itosu sensei, Funakoshi sensei's teacher, had introduced the art pre-1922, to the
                    Japanese mainland in 1922. He taught karate at various Japanese universities and became
                    honorary head of the Japan Karate Association upon its establishment in 1949.</p>
